services : -> 
    - used to transfer data from one component to another component, when components are not related.
    - used to connect the api and get the data from apis and then pass that to controllers.
        -- to connect with api/microservice use HttpClient service and use its methods:
            --- get
            --- post
            --- put
            --- delete
        !!!all above 4 methos will return observable.

        HttpClient will be used for async communication in WebApi.
        But in microservice, if you're using HttpClient, that'll be used for Synchronous comminucation.


- Difference of promise in JS and observable in Angular:
    1. promise can only have two output, either successful or failed, obeservable can be cancelled
    2. promise can only take 1 value at a time, observable can give multiple values at a time
    3. obeservable is lazy loading, whenever use it, need to use subscribe method or it'll not be working



@input/output properties: -> used if the components are related, must be parent and child


Service will be created in a seperate folder, and in that folder, run:
 - ng g s <service-name>
 - ng g s Candidate



 Interceptor:
 - it's a service, and it must be registered, in app.module.ts, interceptors are a bit different,
    to register it, it must be done with creating an object in providers.
 ng g interceptor <name-interceptor>
 this will generate interceptor.ts that is already complied.
